## 💡 My Agile Coaching Philosophy  

As an **Agile Coach and Scrum Master**, I believe in:  

✅ **People over process** – Empowering individuals to take ownership and drive change  
✅ **Servant leadership** – Creating an environment where teams feel psychologically safe to innovate  
✅ **Data-driven decision making** – Using Agile metrics like velocity, cycle time, and burndown charts to continuously improve  
✅ **Business agility** – Helping organizations pivot quickly and respond to market needs  

> "Agile is not just a methodology; it’s a mindset. When teams embrace agility, they don’t just deliver software—they deliver **value**."
